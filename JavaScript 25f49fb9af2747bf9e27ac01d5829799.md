# JavaScript

### Variables/Operators

JavaScript variables can be declared using "let", "var", or "const". For example, `let x = 5;` declares a variable named "x" with a value of 5. 

JavaScript also supports various operators, such as arithmetic, assignment, and comparison operators. For example, `x += 2;` adds 2 to the value of "x" and assigns the result back to "x".

### Datatype

JavaScript supports several datatypes, including **strings, numbers, booleans, objects,** and **arrays.** 

For example, `let name = "John";` declares a string variable named "name" with a value of "John". `let age = 30;` declares a number variable named "age" with a value of 30. `let isStudent = true;` declares a boolean variable named "isStudent" with a value of true.

Arrays can be declared using the syntax `let myArray = [1, 2, 3];` and objects can be declared using the syntax `let myObject = {name: "John", age: 30};`. JavaScript also has special datatypes such as null and undefined. `null` is a value that represents nothing or an empty value, while `undefined` is a value that represents the absence of a value.

***JavaScript datatypes can be categorized into primitive and reference types.***

**Primitive datatypes** include **strings, numbers, booleans, null,** and **undefined.** They are immutable and assigned by value, meaning that each variable holds its own copy of the data.

primitive code example in javascript

Here is a primitive code example in JavaScript:

```jsx
let name = "John";
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");

```

This code defines a variable called `name` and assigns it the value "John". The `console.log()` function is used to output the string "Hello, John!" to the console.

**Reference datatypes** include **objects** and **arrays.** They are mutable and assigned by reference, meaning that variables hold a reference to the same object or array in memory. When a reference variable is used to modify an object or array, all other reference variables pointing to the same object or array will reflect the change.

In JavaScript, reference datatypes include objects, arrays, and functions. Here is an example of how to create a reference datatype in JavaScript:

```jsx
let myArray = [1, 2, 3]; // create an array
let myObject = {name: "John", age: 30}; // create an object
function myFunction() { // create a function
console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Datastructure

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be easily accessed and manipulated. In JavaScript, there are a number of built-in data structures, including arrays, objects, and strings.

- **Arrays** are a collection of elements that are stored in a sequential order. They can be used to store a variety of data types, including numbers, strings, and objects.
- **Objects** are a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are used to identify the values, and the values can be any data type.
- **Strings** are a collection of characters. They can be used to store text, such as names, addresses, and phone numbers.

In addition to the built-in data structures, there are also a number of third-party data structures that can be used in JavaScript. These data structures can be more complex than the built-in data structures, but they can also offer more functionality

```jsx
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Print the first element in the array
console.log(myArray[0]);

// Add a new element to the end of the array
myArray.push(6);

// Remove the last element from the array
myArray.pop();

// Get the length of the array
console.log(myArray.length);
```

```jsx
const myObject = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  address: "123 Main Street, Anytown, USA"
};

// Get the value of the "name" property
console.log(myObject.name);

// Set the value of the "age" property
myObject.age = 31;

// Remove the "address" property
delete myObject.address;
```

```jsx
const myString = "Hello, world!";

// Get the length of the string
console.log(myString.length);

// Convert the string to uppercase
console.log(myString.toUpperCase());

// Split the string into an array of words
const words = myString.split(" ");
```

### Functions

A function in JavaScript is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize and structure code, and to make code more reusable.

To define a function in JavaScript, you use the `function` keyword. The syntax for defining a function is as follows:

```jsx
// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}
```

```jsx
function addfun(){
  var a=10;
  var b=20;
  var c=a+b;
  console.log(c);

}

addfun();
```

### Methods

Sure. A method is a function that is associated with an object. In JavaScript, all objects have methods. Methods are used to perform actions on objects.

Here is an example of a method:

```jsx
const myObject = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
  }
};

```

The `sayHello()` method is associated with the `myObject` object. The `this` keyword refers to the current object, so `this.name` refers to the `name` property of the `myObject` object.

To call a method, you use the object's name, followed by a dot, followed by the method's name. The syntax for calling a method is as follows:

```jsx
myObject.sayHello();

```

This code will print the following to the console:

```jsx
Hello, my name is John Doe
```

### Array

```jsx
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

to view output

```jsx
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(array);

//output [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
```

```jsx
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  console.log(array[i]);
}
```

### For loop

```jsx
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```
