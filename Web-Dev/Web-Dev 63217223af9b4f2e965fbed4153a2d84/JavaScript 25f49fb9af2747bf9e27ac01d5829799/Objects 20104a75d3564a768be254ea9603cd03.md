# Intro to Objects

## **Introduction to objects**

In JavaScript, objects are fundamental data structures that allow you to store and manipulate collections of key-value pairs. They are a key feature of the language and provide a way to represent complex entities, organize data, and define behavior.

```jsx
// Creating an object literal
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
  occupation: "Engineer",
};

// Accessing object properties
console.log(person.name); // Output: "John Doe"
console.log(person.age); // Output: 25
console.log(person.occupation); // Output: "Engineer"

// Modifying object properties
person.age = 26;
console.log(person.age); // Output: 26

// Adding new properties
person.location = "New York";
console.log(person.location); // Output: "New York"
```

In Code 1, an object is created using object literal notation. The object, named "person," is defined with properties such as "name," "age," and "occupation," along with their corresponding values. The properties can be accessed using dot notation, such as **`person.name`**, which returns the value "John Doe". The object properties can also be modified or updated, as shown by changing the value of the "age" property from 25 to 26 using **`person.age = 26`**. Additionally, new properties can be added to the object dynamically, as demonstrated by adding the "location" property with the value "New York" using **`person.location = "New York"`**.

```jsx
// Using the Object constructor
const car = new Object();

// Adding properties to the car object
car.make = "Toyota";
car.model = "Camry";
car.year = 2021;

// Accessing object properties
console.log(car.make); // Output: "Toyota"
console.log(car.model); // Output: "Camry"
console.log(car.year); // Output: 2021

// Modifying object properties
car.year = 2022;
console.log(car.year); // Output: 2022

// Adding a method to the car object
car.start = function () {
  console.log("The car is starting...");
};

// Calling the method
car.start(); // Output: "The car is starting..."
```

An alternative approach of building objects is to first save an empty object literal to a variable, then use the dot notation to declare new properties on the fly, and use the assignment operator to add values to those properties; for example:

```jsx
var house2 = {};
house2.rooms = 4;
house2.color = "pink";
house2.priceUSD = 12345;

console.log(house); // {rooms: 3, color: "brown", priceUSD: 10000}
house.windows = 10;
console.log(house); // {rooms: 3, color: "brown", priceUSD: 10000, windows: 10}
```

## **Object literals and the brackets notation**

There is an alternative syntax to the dot notation I used up until this point.

This alternative syntax is known as *the brackets notation*.

To understand how it works, it's best to use an example, so I'll go through the process of coding the **house2** object again, in the same way that I did with the dot notation, only this time, I'll use the brackets notation.

```jsx
var house2 = {};
house2["rooms"] = 4;
house2['color']= "pink";
house2["priceUSD"] = 12345;
console.log(house2); // {rooms: 4, color: 'pink', priceUSD: 12345}
```

Note that using the brackets notation, I essentially just wrap each property's key **as a string**, inside either the single or double quotes - just like with regular strings.

Then I wrap the entire property key into an opening and a closing square bracket.

That's essentially all there is to it.

I can both access and update properties on objects using either the dot notation, or the brackets notation, or a combination of both, like in the following example:

```jsx
var car = {};
car.color = "red";
car["color"] = "green";
car["speed"] = 200;
car.speed = 100;
console.log(car); // {color: "green", speed: 100}
```

For the time being, this is probably enough information on object creation.

Before I discuss the topic of arrays and objects, let me just give you another important piece of information about the brackets notation.

With the brackets notation, I can add space characters inside property names, like this:

```jsx
console.log(car); // {color: 'green', speed: 100, number of doors: 5}
car["number of doors"] = 4;
```

Additionally, I can add numbers (as the string data type) as property keys:

```jsx
car["2022"] = 1901;
console.log(car); // {2022: 1901, color: 'green', speed: 100, number of doors: 5}
```

However, doing this is discouraged, due to obvious reasons of having a property key as a number string not really conveying a lot of useful information.

Finally, there's one really useful thing that bracket notation has but is not available in the dot notation: It can evaluate expressions.

To understand what that means, consider the following example:

```jsx
var arrOfKeys = ['speed', 'altitude', 'color'];

var drone = {

speed: 100,

altitude: 200,

color: "red"

}

for (var i = 0; i < arrOfKeys.length; i++) {

console.log(drone[arrOfKeys[i]])

}

//The above code will result in the following output:

100
200
red
```

Using the fact that brackets notation can evaluate expressions, I accessed the **arrOfKeys[i]** property on the **drone** object.

This value changed on each loop while the for loop was running.

Specifically, the first time it ran, it was evaluated like this:

- The value of **i** was **0**
- The value of **arrOfKeys[i]** was **arrOfKeys[0]**, which was **"speed"**
- Thus, **drone[arrOfKeys[i]]** was evaluated to **drone["speed"]** which is equal to **100**

This allowed me to loop over each of the values stored inside the **drone** object, based on each of its properties' keys.

# Math object cheat sheet

JavaScript has handy built-in objects. One of these popular built-in objects is the Math object.

By the end of this reading, you'll be able to:

- Outline the built-in properties and methods of the Math object

## **Number constants**

Here are some of the built-in number constants that exist on the Math object:

- The PI number: **Math.PI** which is approximately 3.14159
- The Euler's constant: **Math.E** which is approximately 2.718
- The natural logarithm of 2: **Math.LN2** which is approximately 0.693

## **Rounding methods**

These include:

- **Math.ceil()** - rounds up to the closest integer
- **Math.floor()** - rounds down to the closest integer
- **Math.round()** - rounds up to the closest integer if the decimal is **.5** or above; otherwise, rounds down to the closest integer
- **Math.trunc()** - trims the decimal, leaving only the integer

## **Arithmetic and calculus methods**

Here is a non-conclusive list of some common arithmetic and calculus methods that exist on the **Math** object:

- **Math.pow(2,3)** - calculates the number **2** to the power of **3**, the result is **8**
- **Math.sqrt(16)** - calculates the square root of **16**, the result is **4**
- **Math.cbrt(8)** - finds the cube root of **8**, the result is **2**
- **Math.abs(-10)** - returns the absolute value, the result is **10**
- Logarithmic methods: **Math.log()**, **Math.log2()**, **Math.log10()**
- Return the minimum and maximum values of all the inputs: **Math.min(9,8,7)** returns **7**, **Math.max(9,8,7)** returns **9**.
- Trigonometric methods: **Math.sin()**, **Math.cos()**, **Math.tan()**, etc

## **Object Methods**

```jsx
var car = {};

car.color = "red";

//add a method to the car object so that it can be called as car.turnkey()
car.turnKey = function() { 
  console.log('engine running'); 
}
```

If the function is a property of an object, it is then referred to as a method.

This is a function that can be accessed only through the JavaScript object that it is a member of. For example, the log method, which belongs to the console object, can only be accessed through the console object.

```jsx
//example of adding properties and methods to an object
var car = {};
car.mileage = 98765;
car.color = "red";
console.log(car);
car.turnTheKey = function() {
    console.log("The engine is running")
}
car.lightsOn = function() {
    console.log("The lights are on.")
}
console.log(car);
car.turnTheKey();
car.lightsOn()
```

Ok, so now I have added four properties to my object. And two of those are methods.

I've already ensured that I'm getting the correct **mileage** and **color** from my **car** object. Now, I'll try executing the **turnTheKey** and the **lightsOn** methods.

First, I'll invoke the **turnTheKey** method.

Remember that this method can be accessed only through the **car** object, so I first need to type the name of the object that holds the **turnTheKey** method. In other words, I need to type the word **car**, followed by a dot, and then the name of my method, which is **turnTheKey**.

Remember that this property is a method. So, to run it, I need to append an opening and a closing parenthesis so that the JavaScript engine can process my JavaScript code.

Notice that this results in the **"The engine is running"** string logged to the console.

Now I'll test the other method. Once again, I need to access it through the **car** object, so I type **car.lightsOn**, and again, I need to add those parentheses to invoke the **lightsOn** method. I press the ENTER key and notice the text displays in the console.

Success! It's important to remember that when the JavaScript engine runs this line of code, it locates the **car** object in its memory. Then, it finds the **lightsOn** method on the **car** object. It reads the function declaration that's saved on this property and runs it, line by line.

Since there's only a single line of code, the JavaScript engine logs the string **"The lights are on"** to the console.

# NewNotes

In JavaScript, `let` and `var` are both used to declare variables, but they have some differences in terms of scope and hoisting:

1. Scope: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible within the function they are defined in or, if not in a function, they become global variables accessible throughout the entire program. On the other hand, variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are defined.

Example with `var`:

```jsx
function example() {
  var x = 10;
  if (true) {
    var x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 20
}

```

Example with `let`:

```jsx
function example() {
  let x = 10;
  if (true) {
    let x = 20;
    console.log(x); // Output: 20
  }
  console.log(x); // Output: 10
}

```

In the first example using `var`, the variable `x` is redeclared and assigned a new value within the inner block, affecting its value in the outer scope. However, in the second example using `let`, the variable `x` is block-scoped, so the inner declaration does not affect the value of the variable in the outer scope.

1. Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means you can access and use them before they are declared in the code. However, their values will be undefined until assigned a value. Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted but are not initialized to a value until their declaration statement is encountered.

Example with `var`:

```jsx
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // Output: 10

```

Example with `let`:

```jsx
console.log(x); // Output: ReferenceError: x is not defined
let x = 10;
console.log(x); // Output: 10

```

In the example using `var`, the variable `x` is hoisted, so the first `console.log` statement doesn't throw an error, but its value is undefined. In contrast, the example using `let` throws a `ReferenceError` because the variable `x` is not accessible before its declaration statement.

In general, it is recommended to use `let` and `const` instead of `var` due to their block scope and more predictable behavior. However, there might still be use cases where `var` is preferred, such as when intentionally utilizing its hoisting behavior or when backwards compatibility is a concern.

### creating an object

```jsx
const rectangle = {
  length: 20,
  width: 20
}
console.log(rectangle) // {length: 20, width: 20}

const person = {
  firstName: 'Asabeneh',
  lastName: 'Yetayeh',
  age: 250,
  country: 'Finland',
  city: 'Helsinki',
  skills: [
    'HTML',
    'CSS',
    'JavaScript',
    'React',
    'Node',
    'MongoDB',
    'Python',
    'D3.js'
  ],
  isMarried: true
}
```

### **Getting values from an object**

```jsx
//Using Dot
console.log(person.firstName);

//Using square bracket
console.log(person['firstName'])
```

accessing function 

```jsx
const identity= {
  firstName: 'Samuel',
  middleName: 'Yohannes',
  lastName: 'Asrat',
  fullName: function(){
    return  `${this.firstName} ${this.middleName} ${this.lastName}`
  }
}
//Works
console.log(identity.fullName());

//output
//Samuel Yohannes Asrat

//doesnt work
console.log(identity['fullName()']);
//output
//undefined
```

The square bracket notation (**`[]`**) is used to access object properties by their names as strings, but it does not work for accessing or invoking functions directly. To invoke a function in JavaScript, you need to use parentheses (**`()`**).

### Object Methods

There are different methods to manipulate an object. Let us see some of the available methods.

*Object.assign*: To copy an object without modifying the original object

**copy Objects**

```jsx
const copyPerson = Object.assign({}, person)
console.log(copyPerson)
```

### Getting object keys using Object.keys()

*Object.keys*: To get the keys or properties of an object as an array

```jsx
const keys = Object.keys(copyPerson)
console.log(keys) //['firstName', 'age', 'country','city', 'skills','title', 'address', 'getPersonInfo']
const address = Object.keys(copyPerson.address)
console.log(address) //['street', 'pobox', 'city']
```

### Getting object values using Object.values()

*Object.values*:To get values of an object as an array 

```jsx
const values = Object.values(copyPerson)
console.log(values)
//outputs the values without the objects name
[
  'Asabeneh',
  'Yetayeh',
  250,
  'Finland',
  'Helsinki',
  [
    'HTML',       'CSS',
    'JavaScript', 'React',
    'Node',       'MongoDB',
    'Python',     'D3.js'
  ],
  { street: 'Heitamienkatu 16', pobox: 2002, city: 'Helsinki' },
  [Function: getFullName]
]
```

```jsx
const values = Object.values(copyPerson.address)
console.log(values)
// gives [ 'Heitamienkatu 16', 2002, 'Helsinki' ]
```

### Getting object keys and values using Object.entries()

*Object.entries*:To get the keys and values in an array

```jsx
const entries = Object.entries(copyPerson)
console.log(entries)

//output
[
  [ 'firstName', 'Asabeneh' ],
  [ 'lastName', 'Yetayeh' ],
  [ 'age', 250 ],
  [ 'country', 'Finland' ],
  [ 'city', 'Helsinki' ],
  [
    'skills',
    [
      'HTML',       'CSS',
      'JavaScript', 'React',
      'Node',       'MongoDB',
      'Python',     'D3.js'
    ]
  ],
  [
    'address',
    { street: 'Heitamienkatu 16', pobox: 2002, city: 'Helsinki' }
  ],
  [ 'getFullName', [Function: getFullName] ]
]
```

### Checking properties using hasOwnProperty()

*hasOwnProperty*: To check if a specific key or property exist in an object

```jsx
console.log(copyPerson.hasOwnProperty('name'))
console.log(copyPerson.hasOwnProperty('score'))
```

# Exercise

### level1

1. Create an empty object called dog

```jsx
const dog = {
}
```

1. Print the the dog object on the console

```jsx
console.log(dog);
```

1. Add name, legs, color, age and bark properties for the dog object. The bark property is a method which return *woof woof*

```jsx
dog.name = 'jr'
dog.leg = '3 1/2'
dog.color = 'Brown White'
dog.age = '5'
dog.bark = function(){return 'woof woof'}
```

1. Get name, legs, color, age and bark value from the dog object

```jsx
console.log(`Name: ${dog.name}, Legs: ${dog.leg} color: ${dog.color} 
age: ${dog.age} Bark: ${dog.bark()}  `);
// outputs Name: jr, Legs: 3 1/2 color: Brown White age: 5 Bark: woof woof
```

**`${}`** is used within template literals to perform string interpolation. String interpolation allows you to embed expressions or variables within a string.

Let's break down the code snippet **`console.log(`**Name: ${dog.name}, Legs: ${dog.legs}**`);`** step by step:

1. The **`console.log()`** function is used to output the specified message to the console.
2. The message itself is enclosed within backticks ( **``**) to create a template literal.
3. Inside the template literal, we have the string **`"Name: "`**, which is a static part of the message.
4. Following the static string, **`${dog.name}`** is used. Here, **`${}`** is the syntax for interpolation, and **`dog.name`** is the expression inside the curly braces. This expression refers to the **`name`** property of the **`dog`** object.
5. The **`, Legs:`** is another static part of the message.
6. Lastly, we have **`${dog.legs}`**. Similar to before, this expression refers to the **`legs`** property of the **`dog`** object.

During execution, the expressions within **`${}`** are evaluated and their values are inserted into the resulting string. In this case, the values of **`dog.name`** and **`dog.legs`** are fetched and inserted into the respective positions within the string.

Therefore, the resulting output will be: **`Name: jr, Legs: 3 1/2`**, where **`jr`** is the value of **`dog.name`** and **`3 1/2`** is the value of **`dog.legs`**.

Using template literals with string interpolation can make it easier and more readable to construct strings that incorporate dynamic values from variables or expressions.

1. Set new properties the dog object: breed, getDogInfo

```jsx
dog.breed= dogGetInfo={breed: 'Germen' Age: '65' }
console.log(dog)
```
